Have each node keep track of the min including it and below. So on push, set min of new node
to min of next, or current value depending on which is lower.

Or have a second stack, everytime you push to original stack, check if value is lower than
top of second stack, push to second stack as well if true. When popping, check if value is equal
to top of second stack, if so pop as well from second stack.
