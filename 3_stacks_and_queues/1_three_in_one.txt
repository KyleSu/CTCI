In Java, use a fixed size array. Segway into 3 parts, and track each stack separately.
Make sure each individual stack does not overflow. Also keep track of each stacks top index.

Or use reszing stacks within arrays. When one stack is full, shift everything over.

Python? Well good question, use expanding lists. Keep track of index for each stack. Slice and
shift for additions. Not very size efficient.
